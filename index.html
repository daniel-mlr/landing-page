        <h2>What is Bid-N-Go?</h2>
        <p>Bid-n-Go is a ride sharing system where ride offers are provided
          in blocks rather than as individual seats.  This is the case, for
          example, for bus transportation, or airplane, or, in general,
          vehicules used for mid to long range transit.
        </p>
        <p>
          Other ride sharing systems might offer shared rides in a car with two
          or three additional passengers, but the ride provider (the driver)
          have no guarantee that his vehicule will be used at its optimum
          potential.  With Bid-n-Go, a provider, --say, a bus operator, can see
          in advance the potential income on a given link for a given time by
          monitoring the number of potential passengers on that link.  This
          grants operators a guaranteed minimum income should they chose to
          serve the link. It also provide passengers with a secured seat
          reservation for their journey.

        <h3>Reduces global warming, improve efficient use of scarse ressources</h3>
        <p>
          Private vehicle transportation constitutes the largest source of
          greenhouse gas emission. It also incurs a tremendous cost in term of real
          estate of the road network. By reducing car usage, thereby reducing
          carbon emission per passenger per kilometer as well as increasing
          road efficiency, Bid-n-Go can potentially become a huge contributor
          to a greener environment.

        <h3>Brings transportation services to previously unserviced communities</h3>
        <p>
          Communities which are too small or too remote to be of interest to
          mass transit operators with a fix schedules can now have access to public
          transportation, thus providing viable alternative to private car
          ownership onerous costs.

        <h3>Maximises operators revenues and customers usefulness</h3>
        <p>
          By granting providers with a total flexibility on where and when to offer
          their service, they can maximise their revenues per vehicule. For the
          same reason, origins, destinations and time of travels which are the
          most valuable to customers will have the most chances of being realised.
          Passengers will enjoy a guaranteed ride as well as a total flexibility to
          resell unused reservations.

       <ul>
        <li>She own a minivan of 8 passengers capacity.</li>
        <li>She plan to be in A Thursday morning.</li>
        <li>The system inform her of a potential deal of $60 with 2 passengers
          from A to B via C if she leaves from A between 10:00 am and 10:15 am
        </li>
        <li>The potential income is slightly below her cost but until the
          departure time she could sell the six remaining seats from A to B
          and/or the 7 remaining seats from B to C.</li>
        <li>Hence, she confirms the departure for Thursday 10:15 am. The two
          travellers so far are notified of the departure time and the money is
          transfered from their account to the provider.</li>
        <li>The system automatically lists the remaining seats and automatically
          sells them to oncoming passengers at a predetermined fixed price or at
          an optimal price calculated by the system based on past history.</li>

      <h3>Why is it good for travellers?</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>They can plan their journey as long in advance as they need, anywhere
          they wish to go, however remote. </li>
        <li>
          They are not locked into a scarce and inconvenient bus time schedule or,
          as it is most often the case, to a non-existing one.
        </li>
        <li>
          If there is no transport offer yet for the time they need to the
          destination they wish to go, they can bid an amount proportional to
          their desire to attract providers. The system can suggest them optimal
          bid amount for this destination and time frame based on past history.
        </li>
        <li>Once a deal is closed, they are guaranteed a seat.</li>
        <li>
          If there is already an ongoing transport offer, they just buy their
          seat from the provider. The system then acts like a classic
          reservation system.
        </li>
        <li>
          Total flexibility. If you, as a passenger, need to change your
          travel plan after the deal have been closed, you don't necessary loose
          your money. You can just list your place for sell, the same way that
          providers sell their remaining empty seats.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Why is it good for transport providers ?</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>They can plan the optimally paying routes in advance, taking into
          account their own constraints.</li>
        <li>They benefit from the help of the system doing data analysis for
          them to plan those optimal routes.</li>
        <li>They keep their vehicle rolling, making the most of their
          investments.</li>
        <li>Providers of any size can chip in. Vehicle are not limited to
          intercity coaches: they can be minivan, large bus or even airplanes or
          boats, where appropriated.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Why is it good for everybody else ?</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Reduced amount of cars on the road: less gas emissions, less
          congestion for the remaining cars and less road maintenance costs.
        </li>
        <li>
          Reconnects and revitalize communities previously unserviced -- or
          poorly serviced-- by public transportation.</li>
        <li>
          Higher road usage efficiency hence lesser need to widen roads.</li>
